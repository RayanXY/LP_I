## Hash Table ##

### What is it? ###

A Data Structure which an associative array, that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to define the index to where the data will be storaged and can be found. Ideally, the function will assign an unique key to every element, but most hash funtions causes collisions (two or more elements assigned to the same index).

### Functions ###

`insert()`: Inserts new elements in the table.

`remove()`: Removes an elements from the table.

`retrieve()`: Retrives data from the table.

`empty()`: Checks if the table is empty.

`clear()`: Removes all the data from the table. 

`print()`: Prints all data from the table.

`size()`: Returns the actual size from the table.

`count()`: Returns the number of elements in the table.

`rehash()`: Doubles the table's size.
